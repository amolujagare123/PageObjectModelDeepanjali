UI testing is about look and feel of an web page.

1. keep test src page name same as of Regression\LoginTest. as UI_Testing\LoginTest.
2. Every web element will having its own test such as isDisplayed() and isEnabled() respectively which are displayed in Web page.
3. isDisplayed is in-built function so use different function name.
4. make web elements as public in pages. i.e. src\Login.java
5.Different fuctions can be written on single web element like isDisplayed,isEnabled, gettext().
6. Can write a single function with different web elements exmaple for Visibility() - email & pwd doni ekach fn madhe lihu sakto
